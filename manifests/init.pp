#
# @example
#   include aide

#   Location of AIDE database file.
#
# @db_temp_path
#   Location of update AIDE database file.
#
# @gzip_dbout
#   Gzip the AIDE database file (may affect performance). Default is set to not gzip the database file.
#
# @aide_path
#   Location of aide binary.
#
# @config_template
#   Template to use for aide configuration.
#
# @aide_log
#   AIDE check output log.
#
# @syslogout
#   Enables logging to the system logging service AUTH facility and '/var/log/messages'.
#
# @hour
#   Hour of cron job to run.
#
# @minute
#   Minute of cron job to run.
#
# @nocheck
#   Whether to enable or disable scheduled checks.
#

#   Puppet default exec timeout is 300 (which is also kept),
#   but this may be insufficient for more complex aide DBs.
